## Chunk-oriented Processing?

> Spring Batch uses a 'Chunk-oriented' processing style within its most common implementation. Chunk oriented processing refers to reading the data one at a time and creating 'chunks' that are written out within a transaction boundary. Once the number of items read equals the commit interval, the entire chunk is written out by the ItemWriter, and then the transaction is committed. The following image shows the process:

- Tasklet vs Chunk
> While Tasklets feel more natural for ‘one task after the other' scenarios, chunks provide a simple solution to deal with paginated reads or situations where we don't want to keep a significant amount of data in memory.

> Not only does it get rid of OOME problems, but it is also convenient for maintenance.

## ItemStream?
> Both ItemReaders and ItemWriters serve their individual purposes well, but there is a common concern among both of them that necessitates another interface. In general, as part of the scope of a batch job, readers and writers need to be opened, closed, and require a mechanism for persisting state. The ItemStream interface serves that purpose, as shown in the following example:
~~~java
public interface ItemStream {

    void open(ExecutionContext executionContext) throws ItemStreamException;

    void update(ExecutionContext executionContext) throws ItemStreamException;

    void close() throws ItemStreamException;
}
~~~
- ItemReader, ItemWriter는 ItemStream를 Implement


## ItemReader?
> Although a simple concept, an ItemReader is the means for providing data from many different types of input. The most general examples include:
- Flat File(.txt, .xlsx)
- XML
- Database

~~~java
public interface ItemReader<T> {

    T read() throws Exception, UnexpectedInputException, ParseException, NonTransientResourceException;

}
~~~
- Calling it returns one item or null if no more items are left

~~~ java
  @Override
  protected T doRead() throws Exception {
    T next = null;
    if (cursorIterator.hasNext()) {
      next = cursorIterator.next();
    }
    return next;
  }
~~~
- CursorReader
  - Not thread safe
  - Cursor-based
  - High real-time
  
  
~~~ java
  @Override
  protected void doReadPage() {
    Map<String, Object> parameters = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    if (parameterValues != null) {
      parameters.putAll(parameterValues);
    }
    parameters.put("_page", getPage());
    parameters.put("_pagesize", getPageSize());
    parameters.put("_skiprows", getPage() * getPageSize());
    if (results == null) {
      results = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<T>();
    } else {
      results.clear();
    }
    results.addAll(sqlSessionTemplate.<T> selectList(queryId, parameters));
  }
~~~
- PagingReader
  - Thread safe(Multi threading)
  - Offset-based
  - High performance

## ItemProceessor?
> An ItemProcessor is simple. Given one object, transform it and return another. The provided object may or may not be of the same type. The point is that business logic may be applied within the process, and it is completely up to the developer to create that logic. An ItemProcessor can be wired directly into a step. For example, assume an ItemReader provides a class of type Foo and that it needs to be converted to type Bar before being written out. The following example shows an ItemProcessor that performs the conversion:
~~~java
public interface ItemProcessor<I, O> {

    O process(I item) throws Exception;
}
~~~

~~~java
CompositeItemProcessor<Foo,Foobar> compositeProcessor =
                                      new CompositeItemProcessor<Foo,Foobar>();
List itemProcessors = new ArrayList();
itemProcessors.add(new FooProcessor());
itemProcessors.add(new BarProcessor());
compositeProcessor.setDelegates(itemProcessors);
~~~
- Chaining(여러 개 프로세스를 엮을 수 있음)

~~~java
@Bean
public ValidatingItemProcessor itemProcessor() {
	ValidatingItemProcessor processor = new ValidatingItemProcessor();

	processor.setValidator(validator());

	return processor;
}

@Bean
public SpringValidator validator() {
	SpringValidator validator = new SpringValidator();

	validator.setValidator(new TradeValidator());

	return validator;
}
~~~
- Validate


- Filtering
  - To filter a record, you can return null from the ItemProcessor

## ItemWriter?
> ItemWriter is similar in functionality to an ItemReader but with inverse operations. Resources still need to be located, opened, and closed but they differ in that an ItemWriter writes out, rather than reading in. In the case of databases or queues, these operations may be inserts, updates, or sends. The format of the serialization of the output is specific to each batch job.
~~~java
public interface ItemWriter<T> {

    void write(List<? extends T> items) throws Exception;

}
~~~
